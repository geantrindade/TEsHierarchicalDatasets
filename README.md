# Hierarchical Classification Datasets Of Transposable Elements

These are Hierarchical Classification datasets of Transposable Elements suitable for Machine Learning algorithms. These datasets were used in several papers published in top tier conferences, such as The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) and The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO).
